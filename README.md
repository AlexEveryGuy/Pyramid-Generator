Hello!

This is one of my first small projects using JavaScript. 
This small program can generate a pyramid using any character, with different numbers of rows utilizing an array. 

The pyramid can also be inverted by adjusting the "inverted" boolean value between 'true' and 'false'.

I had fun making this one and looking forward to making more challenging projects ahead!
